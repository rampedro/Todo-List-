### Some Analytics for EHR and census data

Next, we examine the rate at which the DUHS EHRs capture the county population of children. We estimate capture rates as:

𝐶𝑎𝑝𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑐= 𝐸𝐻𝑅𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑐/𝐴𝐶𝑆𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑐,
where c is the geographic unit (county or census tract), EHR count is the number of children in the EHR cohort who have at least one relevant encounter and reside in the geographic unit, and ACS estimate is the ACS-estimated number of children residing in the geographic unit. Thus, the capture rates are measured as the estimated proportion of children with at least one relevant DUHS encounter during the study period in a defined area

### Benefits of Combined Electronic healht records and Census/survey data

Neighborhood disparities in health outcomes can reflect unequal access to social and economic resources—often resulting from differences in neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics or structural forms of racism—that shape both individuals’ risk of illness and access to adequate health care services (Aysola, Orav, and Ayanian 2011; Beck et al. 2017, 2020). Public health policies and programs that leverage local data are essential for targeting the underlying causes of disease to improve population health (Acevedo-Garcia et al. 2008; Beck et al. 2017). Health surveys that describe individuals’ health profiles allow for population representative analyses at the national or state levels but often constrain accurate descriptions at smaller levels of geography because of small sample size (Birkhead 2017; Tomasallo et al. 2014).

Not simply a digital version of a paper record (127), EHRs can be linked to contextual data using geographic information systems (GIS) and combined with self-reported data to address questions about complex networks of causation. Such work has the potential to evolve epidemiologic theory in the twenty-first century (69, 86).

### challenges of EHR

 ecause EHRs are primarily used for administrative purposes, their structure can complicate data extraction and coding for population health studie .Furthermore, while developing the coding scheme for health conditions can be complex for EHRs, this information can be shared across research teams to reduce burdens and ensure consistency of health condition definitions across studies.

### EHR tasks

Social scientists, health practitioners, and policymakers can use EHR data to evaluate the prevalence of chronic diseases among local children, to compare prevalence rates across subgroups and small geographic areas, and to examine changes in rates over time

##### The utilization of EHR data:

can have multiple applications, including making aggregated census tract data on children’s health publicly available on an interactive webpage that allows policymakers and community organizers to examine current health patterns when developing public health strategies or community-based programs

 EHRs can also be combined with contextual data accessed from data sources such as the ACS or through partnerships with community organizations to provide a multidimensional understanding of the relationship between individual and neighborhood characteristics and health outcomes.

 large number ppl captured by the EHRs provide a unique opportunity to study small population subgroups and allow for meaningful population health comparisons across racial-ethnic, socioeconomic, and age groups

Using EHR data to evaluate patterns of specialty and emergency department use across subgroups and census tracts can also inform our understanding of inequities in health and health care use or quality (Beck et al. 2014, 2016; Rees et al. 2020).

### bias of EHR, and realtion to Neighbourhood :

For example, when using EHRs to identify hot spots of disease or evaluate relationships between neighborhood characteristics and health outcomes, researchers and practitioners must account for selection biases related to who is captured in EHR data based on neighborhood characteristics, such as spatial proximity to adjacent health systems, racial-ethnic composition of neighborhoods, and poverty rates

ability to access its services also shape entry into that health system such that the population included in EHRs is often not representative of the target population to whom reference is made (Bower et al. 2017). Prior work suggests that individual characteristics such as gender, age, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status and health insurance coverage predict health system entry and utilization

Characteristics of neighborhood are also associated with health system entry in ways that may bias EHR-based analyses. Measures of social cohesion, safety, and the built environment are associated with the use of primary care services


The potential for neighborhood characteristics to introduce bias in EHR-based analyses is exacerbated by the relationship between those same characteristics and health outcomes. Both neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics (Carroll-Scott et al. 2013; Rees et al. 2020) and racial composition (Bell et al. 2006; Kotecki et al. 2019) are associated with the prevalence of a wide-range of children’s health outcomes, which in-turn drive entry into a health system. These characteristics also likely combine to uniquely shape health risks and access to care (Beck et al. 2020).
