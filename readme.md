### Benefits of Combined Electronic healht records and Census/survey data

Neighborhood disparities in health outcomes can reflect unequal access to social and economic resources—often resulting from differences in neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics or structural forms of racism—that shape both individuals’ risk of illness and access to adequate health care services (Aysola, Orav, and Ayanian 2011; Beck et al. 2017, 2020). Public health policies and programs that leverage local data are essential for targeting the underlying causes of disease to improve population health (Acevedo-Garcia et al. 2008; Beck et al. 2017). Health surveys that describe individuals’ health profiles allow for population representative analyses at the national or state levels but often constrain accurate descriptions at smaller levels of geography because of small sample size (Birkhead 2017; Tomasallo et al. 2014).

Not simply a digital version of a paper record (127), EHRs can be linked to contextual data using geographic information systems (GIS) and combined with self-reported data to address questions about complex networks of causation. Such work has the potential to evolve epidemiologic theory in the twenty-first century (69, 86).

### bias of EHR, and realtion to Neighbourhood :

ability to access its services also shape entry into that health system such that the population included in EHRs is often not representative of the target population to whom reference is made (Bower et al. 2017). Prior work suggests that individual characteristics such as gender, age, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status and health insurance coverage predict health system entry and utilization

Characteristics of neighborhood are also associated with health system entry in ways that may bias EHR-based analyses. Measures of social cohesion, safety, and the built environment are associated with the use of primary care services
