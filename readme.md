### Benefits of Combined Electronic healht records and Census/survey data

Neighborhood disparities in health outcomes can reflect unequal access to social and economic resources—often resulting from differences in neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics or structural forms of racism—that shape both individuals’ risk of illness and access to adequate health care services (Aysola, Orav, and Ayanian 2011; Beck et al. 2017, 2020). Public health policies and programs that leverage local data are essential for targeting the underlying causes of disease to improve population health (Acevedo-Garcia et al. 2008; Beck et al. 2017). Health surveys that describe individuals’ health profiles allow for population representative analyses at the national or state levels but often constrain accurate descriptions at smaller levels of geography because of small sample size (Birkhead 2017; Tomasallo et al. 2014).

Not simply a digital version of a paper record (127), EHRs can be linked to contextual data using geographic information systems (GIS) and combined with self-reported data to address questions about complex networks of causation. Such work has the potential to evolve epidemiologic theory in the twenty-first century (69, 86).
